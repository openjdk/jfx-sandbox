     *
     * If there is an error during reservation for some reason, returns a Region
     * struct filled with zeros (null CPU, null GPU, 0 size).
     *
     * @p alignment has to be provided on-reservation because different resources
     * use different alignment types. Here are some examples:
     *   - 256 (D3D12_CONSTANT_BUFFER_DATA_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) - CBuffer data
     *   - 4KB (D3D12_SMALL_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) - small Textures
     *   - 64KB (D3D12_SMALL_MSAA_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) - small MSAA Textures
     *   - 64KB (D3D12_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) - Buffers and Textures
     *   - 4MB (D3D12_DEFAULT_MSAA_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) - MSAA Textures
     *
     * Since the Ring Buffer should be as oblivious as possible to the Resource type being
     * allocated, it makes the most sense for us to provide the alignment per-reservation.
     * For more info on alignment and what "small Textures" are see:
