// A variant of regular Ring Buffer which utilizes two buffers at once.

// Command List is flushed this Buffer will perform a copy to a GPU-side
// Resource.
// Upload heaps are enough in case of GPU-reads-once data (ex. shader
// constants) however for other data like Vertices submitted via RenderQuads
// Upload heap can create performance constraints, especially on discrete
// GPUs.

     *
     * @p flushThreshold determines when Ring Buffer will trigger a Command List
     * flush on the attached device. Threshold is determined in bytes. If provided
     * threshold is larger than @p size it will be forced to @p size.
     *
     * If @p size is 0 bytes (aka. its default value) the size will be calculated
     * to 3 times the size of @p flushThreshold to implement "triple-buffering" of
     * mid-frame data, which seemed to provide the best results. Realistically,
     * the only RingContainer-based class that needs a custom size should be the
     * Sampler Heap.
     *
     * @p alignment has to be one of:
     *   - 256 (D3D12_CONSTANT_BUFFER_DATA_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) - CBuffer data
     *   - 4KB (D3D12_SMALL_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) - small Textures
     *   - 64KB (D3D12_SMALL_MSAA_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) - small MSAA Textures
     *   - 64KB (D3D12_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) - Buffers and Textures
     *   - 4MB (D3D12_DEFAULT_MSAA_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT) - MSAA Textures
     *
     * Since the Ring Buffer should be as oblivious as possible to the Resource type being
     * allocated, it makes the most sense for us to provide the alignment per-reservation.
     * For more info on alignment and what "small Textures" are see:
     *    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_resource_desc#alignment
